# Feature Scaffold Vue

Create a consistent feature skeleton for this repository.

## Inputs To Confirm
Collect these values from the request or infer safely:
- Feature name in kebab-case (example: `lineup-filters`).
- Whether UI is required (`.vue` component) or logic-only (`.ts` module).
- Whether API integration is required now or left as TODO.

If not provided, default to a UI feature with local mock data and TODO markers for backend wiring.

## Scaffolding Workflow
1. Normalize the feature name to kebab-case and create `src/features/<feature-name>/`.
2. Create starter files: `index.ts`, `<FeatureName>.vue` (UI features), `use<FeatureName>.ts`, `types.ts`, and `README.md`.
3. Create mirrored tests under `tests/features/<feature-name>/`: `<FeatureName>.spec.ts` and `use<FeatureName>.test.ts`.
4. Wire top-level exports only if the repo already has an aggregator pattern; otherwise leave local exports in feature scope.
5. Add explicit TODOs for unresolved dependencies (API endpoints, store contracts, design tokens).

## Quality Gates
- Follow repository conventions from `AGENTS.md`.
- 2-space indentation, `PascalCase` components, `camelCase` functions.
- Use Yarn-based commands and Vitest naming patterns.
- Do not introduce alternate tooling unless asked.
- Ensure tests include at least one happy path and one failure/edge path.


## Inlined Agent Config

Source: agents/openai.yaml

```yaml
interface:
  display_name: "Feature Scaffold Vue"
  short_description: "Scaffold Vue feature modules"
  default_prompt: "Use this skill to scaffold a Vue 3 feature module in src/features with mirrored Vitest tests under tests/features and minimal starter files aligned to AGENTS.md."
```

# Scaffold Template

Use this blueprint for a feature named `<feature-name>` with component `<FeatureName>`.

```text
src/features/<feature-name>/
  index.ts
  <FeatureName>.vue
  use<FeatureName>.ts
  types.ts
  README.md

tests/features/<feature-name>/
  <FeatureName>.spec.ts
  use<FeatureName>.test.ts
```

## `index.ts`
```ts
export { default as <FeatureName> } from './<FeatureName>.vue'
export * from './types'
export * from './use<FeatureName>'
```

## `types.ts`
```ts
export interface <FeatureName>State {
  loading: boolean
  error: string | null
}
```

## `use<FeatureName>.ts`
```ts
import { ref } from 'vue'

export function use<featureName>() {
  const loading = ref(false)
  const error = ref<string | null>(null)

  return { loading, error }
}
```

## Test baseline
- Add one happy-path assertion.
- Add one edge/failure assertion.
- Keep tests deterministic (no network calls in unit tests).
